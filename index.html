                <p class="project-description">China’s college campuses are often located in the places with lush trees and surrounded by mountains and rivers. Moreover, at the beginning of the construction of campus environment, most of them were designed and planned based on the theory of traditional Chinese landscape gardens. However, during the transformation and expansion process of modern colleges and universities, the new architectural forms and styles are rarely combined with the original design intentions, which makes the architectures on campus are getting rid of hybridity or genealogy of historical architectural styles. </p>

                <p class="project-description">The campus architectural typology in Wuhan University was derived from the modern improvement of Chinese traditional architectural style. My obsession is: How can the high-rise campus apartment architecture design inherit the existing modern architectural typology? This project attempts to decode the types of campus building through a suit of INSTALLATION DESIGN, and henceforth applies the research results of this installation to the preliminary architectural morphology design of the campus high-rise apartment.</p>

                <p class="project-description">The conventional renovation design of historical building usually begins with repairing of the interior of the historical buildings, so as to ensure the stability of the buildings and try to ensure that ‘repair as old as possible’. However, Aldo Rossi’s (1984) viewpoint to the permanent characteristics of urban architecture heritages are dynamic in his book “The Architecture of the City”: the function of a sprawling city is changing so that the positioning of historical buildings naturally needs to change accordingly. At my project site – Bagong House – in the past, as an example of collective housing type within the concession area of Wuhan, it is the structure and room scale of the typical apartment building typology that makes the internal transformation extremely difficult. At present, the historical blocks around Bagong House are gradually being replaced by modern retail and service shops. Therefore, it is more necessary to take the most advantages of the particularity of these existing conditions because of the conspicuous architectural volume of Bagong House and the special spatial location at the remarkable triangular traffic fork.</p>

                <p class="project-description">This project does not adopt conventional strategies of interior architectural renovation, but consequently it completes the following advantage through the addition of new architecture. Firstly, the original building was preserved. Secondly, utilizing the innovative structure of Busan Film Center (built from 2005-2011) by Coop Himmelblau and Christoph Gengnagel, the vacant space of the atrium can be used as the base of the main supporting structure. Thirdly, the interior of the additional building is compatible with a small indoor square. Last but not the least, Elevation surface differ according to different directions, which echoes to the different urban rooftop landscapes from bigger scope.</p>

                <p class="project-description">This individual project is an economical tourist hotel architectural design based on the simulation of wind-erosion land-form and Waving Function Collapse (WFC) algorithm in Las Vegas. The cost of rooms accounts for most of the tourism consumption in Las Vegas, and the high cost of tourist rooms exacerbated the continued downturn after the outbreak of Covid-19. So the question is, why can’t we design some cheap hotels in peripheral areas? The unique local wind erosion landform is the main disadvantage that hinders the construction of conventional building here. Unexpectedly, there are plant communities with a certain scale growing at the bottom of the rock cliff. The location of plant growth harbors the possibilities of building housing under wind erosion land form. If the hotel can conform to the impact of wind erosion, it can coexist with wind erosion conditions.</p>

                <p class="project-description">This project aims to design a digital estate visualization system demonstrating the value fluctuation from coincident economic indices. As space products, architectures cannot only accommodate human’s habitat, but also have the property of carrying transactions in commodity attributes. As the development of Manhattan tends to be saturated, the existing physical buildings also limit the re-entry of real estate capital into the market of the region. This project has designed a set of digital real estate visualization app that combines the changes of upper economic indices.
                    Next to it, the vacant space above the Crosslands Transportation beside Hudson Yards is taken as an example site to generate a virtual Podium-Tower model for the future real estate investment and transaction.

                <p class="project-description">The intention of capital is to regard architectures as a form of commodity, and more importantly, to regard architectures as life based products that has been held for a longer term while their reliability is visible to the public. Even though architectures are solid in the eyes of most ordinary people and are continuously needed by citizens. Architectures still cannot escape the undulating value as commodities in the overall economic environment. The stability of architectures is worth being questioned in essence.</p>

Plaudits from international lifestyle’s magazines and travel journalists contrast with statistics of extremes of unemployment, poverty and drug addiction. The city’s strategy for regeneration is likely to further polarize the social fabric of the city, with promotion of its first identity invariably involving the concealing, denial or cleansing of the second.
                    This project will not be complicit in this gentrification process. Instead, we will imagine a different agency for architecture, where we can conceive new socio-spatial formation under different economic imperatives. We will consider a new compact waterfront, compressing the components of the previous abandoned attempt at a “social condenser”—housing, shopping, education, businesses, civic and cultural facilities—stretched along the artificial landscape of Dundee’s waterfront in new formations of social-space, realized in new architectural form. A second attempt at the future.
